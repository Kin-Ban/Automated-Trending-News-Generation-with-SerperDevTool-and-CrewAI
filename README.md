# Automated-Trending-News-Generation-with-SerperDevTool-and-CrewAI


This project showcases an automated system for generating trending news articles based on user-defined topics. Leveraging CrewAI, the system orchestrates two AI agents: a News Researcher and a News Writer. The Researcher agent utilizes SerperDevTool to search the web and gather the latest information, while the Writer agent crafts the final news article using Gemini Pro LLM.

Key Features:

Automated Workflow: Agents collaborate to research and write news articles autonomously, providing real-time results.
Advanced Language Models: Uses Gemini Pro LLM for natural language generation, ensuring high-quality content.
Real-Time Data Retrieval: Integrates SerperDevTool for up-to-date web searches.
Markdown Output: Final articles are saved in markdown format for easy sharing and publishing.
Scalable and Adaptable: Designed to handle various topics, with potential for expansion.
This project demonstrates how AI can streamline the process of news generation, from research to publication, using cutting-edge tools and models.
